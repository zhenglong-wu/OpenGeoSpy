- ask_why_not: User asks why a particular location was not chosen (e.g., "why not Turkey?", "why isn't it Greece?")
- zoom_feature: User asks about a specific visual feature (e.g., "what does the sign say?", "zoom into the building")
- try_search: User wants to trigger a new search with specific terms (e.g., "try searching for X", "google the restaurant name")
- compare: User wants to compare two candidates (e.g., "compare #1 and #2", "difference between top candidates")
- explain: User wants explanation of evidence (e.g., "explain why Paris", "what evidence supports this?")
- refine_hint: User provides a location hint to narrow down the search area (e.g., "I think it's in Southeast Asia", "narrow it down to Turkey", "around Istanbul", "the image is from Germany")
- general: General question or comment not matching other intents

IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS:
- "try searching for [business name]" → try_search (user wants to search for a specific thing)
- "I think it's in [place]" or "narrow it down to [place]" → refine_hint (user provides location context for fresh discovery)
- "why not [place]?" → ask_why_not (user questions why a location wasn't chosen)

User message: {message}

Respond with only the intent name (one of the above), nothing else."""
